# Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur (Work in Progress)

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in intermediate work on the Infocom game Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur.

## Where did it come from?

This repository was forked from [zil-legacy/arthur-rmid2-eblong](https://github.com/zil-legacy/arthur-rmid2-eblong).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if a game file can still be built from the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
